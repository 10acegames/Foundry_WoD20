# World of Darkness 20th ed
This is a non-official (fan-made) system.

- Vampire the Masquerade 20th ed
- Mage the Ascention 20th ed
- Werewolf the Apocalypse 20th ed

I would never require it by anyone or even expect someone to do but if you really want to feel free to [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/johanfk) :)
